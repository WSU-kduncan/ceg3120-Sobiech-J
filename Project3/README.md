Project 3 things to note:

Line 3 kept throwing exceptions when I tried to load it into AWS. I commented out the line and the template worked afterwards.

Line 3: "Testing area for AWS: This template builds a Linux VM for CEG 3120 @ WSU."
The original line says CEG 2350 which I changed to CEG 3120.

Please note the misspelling of 'internal' on line 84 of original template: "Enable SSH access via port 22 and open all insternal ports."
